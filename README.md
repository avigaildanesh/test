# test
Full-stack Dockerized app with React frontend, Node.js backend, TiDB database, and Kafka. Includes login API (`/api/login`) with token generation and log4js logging (timestamp, userId, IP, action). Database is initialized via `init.sql` on startup using a `db-init` container. Default user: admin@admin.com / 123456. Kafka consumer implemented; TiCDC integration was not included due to time constraints.  To run: `docker compose up --build`.
